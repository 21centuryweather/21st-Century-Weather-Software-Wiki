# Getting started on gadi

The National Computing Infrastructure (NCI) hosts the supercomputer `gadi` where you will be conducting most of your research.

## Accessing `gadi` via a terminal.

The [ACCESS-NRI]([https://www.access-nri.org.au) team have created some handy tutorials to help you get started on `gadi`.

Click [here](https://access-hive.org.au/getting_started/set_up_nci_account/) to find out how to 
- Create an account on `gadi`
- Join relevant projects (giving you access to computational and disk storage resources)
- Configure your 'Secure Shell Protocol' (`ssh`) so you can log into `gadi` automatically from your personal computer.

Thanks ACCESS-NRI!

## Using the Australian Research Environment (ARE)

NCI have created a set of web-based graphical tools to help perform your computational research. These tools (including a Virtual Desktop and the `JupyterLab` environment) are made available via the 'Australian Research Environment' (ARE) on gadi.

ACCESS-NRI have created a quick tutorial to show you how to start an ARE session.

Click [here](https://access-hive.org.au/getting_started/are/) to find out how to 
- create a Virtual Desktop Interface (VDI)
- launch a `JuypterLab` session

Thanks to ACCESS-NRI once again!
