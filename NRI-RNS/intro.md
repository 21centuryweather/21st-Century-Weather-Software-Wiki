# Regional Atmospheric Modeling

**ACCESS-rAM**

ACCESS-NRI has developed a nested Regional Atmospheric (rAM) suite using the Unified Model for conducting high-resolution experiments over sub-sections of the Australian domain using multiple nested domains.

The first beta release of ACCESS-rAM is now available. You can find all relevant documentation at the [ACCESS-Hive Docs](https://access-hive.org.au/models/run-a-model/run-access-ram/) website maintained by ACCESS-NRI.

Thanks to ACCESS-NRI team for developing and maintaining this suite!
