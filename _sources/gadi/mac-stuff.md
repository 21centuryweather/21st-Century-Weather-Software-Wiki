# Working with gadi via your Mac

Mac OS interfaces very well with Unix/Linux systems (like gadi), because Mac OS is itself based on an old version of Unix called 'BSD'.

However, there are a few tricks you need to know before you can seamlessly work with gadi on your Mac desktop.

## Direct connection via ssh

You can access a gadi login node directly from your Mac OS Terminal with the command
``` 
ssh username@gadi.nci.org.au
```
To avoid typing in your gadi username and password every time you login, you will want to append the local ssh 'public key' from your Mac to your remote 'authorized keys' file on gadi.

This can be done in three easy steps by following the instructions:

https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2008/11/3-steps-to-perform-ssh-login-without-password-using-ssh-keygen-ssh-copy-id/

In those instructions, you will need to include your gadi username, because those instructions assume your local and remote usernames are the same (which is highly unlikely in our case.)

So in Step 2, you will need to type
```
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub username@gadi.nci.org.au
```
where 'username' is your actual gadi username, e.g. 'ab1234'.

If you want to access graphical applications on gadi remotely (e.g. `emacs`, `rose GUI`, `Microsoft VS Code` etc) you will need to allow 'X windows forwarding' between your local terminal session and gadi. You activate this using the `-X` flag, e.g.
``` 
ssh -X username@gadi.nci.org.au
```
**BUT** : You will **NOT** be able to interact with graphical apps on gadi until you complete the steps below.

## X-windows support

The native Mac OS uses 'Quartz' to generate Mac Graphical-User-Interface 'Aqua'. Unix uses the `X Windows` protocol : 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System

Mac OS used to natively support X windows out-of-the-box, but this support was removed in 2012. Nowadays you have to install `Xquartz` to support X windows on a Mac.

https://www.xquartz.org

You can install this manually if you have sys-admin privileges, otherwise your site sys-admin will have to do it for you.

To check that X-windows support is working correctly, try the following after you have installed `Xquartz`.
```
ssh -X username@gadi.nci.org.au

$ xeyes
```
A small window of two 'eyeballs' should pop-up which will track the movement of your cursor across your desktop.

This means that X window forwarding is now allowed between gadi and your Mac.

In order to maintain your `ssh` session without gadi closing your connection after small periods of inactivity, it is suggested you enter the following in the `~/ssh/.config` file on your Mac:
```
Host *
  ServerAliveInterval 60
  ForwardX11 yes
  ForwardX11Trusted yes
  TCPKeepAlive no

Host gadi.nci.org.au
  HostName gadi.nci.org.au
  User <insert your username here>
```

## Command-line tricks with Mac ##

While Gadi uses the `bash` shell, Mac OS uses the `zsh` shell by default. When using command-line tools like `scp` to copy files from gadi to your local Mac, you will need to be aware of the following when using 'wildcard' characters to glob files.

For example, this how to list all `.txt` files in your Mac's home directory directory:
```
% ls ~/*.txt
```
The same command will work on gadi once you have created an `ssh` session. But, what if I want to retrieve all `.txt` files form gadi to my Mac using the `scp` command? Normally you would try this:

```
% scp username@gadi.nci.org.au:~/*.txt .
```
This **WILL NOT** work, because `zsh` interprets wildcard characters differently to `bash` when using multiple command-line arguments. To make the above command work, you need to place quotes around the command, i.e.
```
% scp 'username@gadi.nci.org.au:~/*.txt' .
```
