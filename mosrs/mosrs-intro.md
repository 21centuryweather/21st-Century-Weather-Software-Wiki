# MOSRS #

The UK Met Office Science Repository Service (MOSRS) is located at: https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/self-service/. The repository contains all the files and documentation required for the UK Met Office to co-ordinate co-operative research between itself, partner meteorological agencies (e.g. Australia's Bureau of Meteorology, Meteorological Service Singapore, New Zealand's NIWA etc.) and research partners (e.g. University of Reading, University of Melbourne, ANU etc.)

Once you have access to MOSRS you will be able to download `rose/cylc` suites onto `gadi` and begin performing your weather and climate simulations.
