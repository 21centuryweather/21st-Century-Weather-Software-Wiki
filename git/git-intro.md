Probably we all have, or had something like this at one point because we didn’t use a version control system. Version control systems manage the evolution and changes of a set of files that we’ll call repository. If you ever looked at the history of a Google Docs file, it is like that but in a very controlled way. Git is one popular version control system.

If you work alone, git is great to track changes and recover previous version of your files. You can also use a remote repository to have a back up and share your work.

If you work as a team you can take advantage of all the above and also use version control as a tool to collaborate and organize the various versions of the same file present in the multiple computers you and they use.
